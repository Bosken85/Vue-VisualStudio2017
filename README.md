## ASP.NET Core, Visual Studio 2017, Vue and ES6 (ES2015)

Integration of back-end and front-end development workflows has given me some sleepless nights. I have been always thrilled by the idea of writing JavaScript code using all the ES6 features, fancy libraries like Vue and making it all happen within my favorite technology and IDE - ASP.NET and Visual Studio.

I could successfully convert this idea to reality. I would like to share with you how to do and benefit from it.
